ToDo
--------

Need to implement PID control logic for the wheels. 
Need to coordinate the 6 wheels movement, use the servo loop to provide a constant time base.


Control loop needs to calculate the expected distance travelled for each wheel, compare to the actual distance traveled 
and use that to determine an error correction factor to apply to the PWM value.

Question: how can I implement this in a way that keeps the code well structured?
