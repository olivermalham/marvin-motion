ToDo
--------

Need to implement PID control logic for the wheels. 
Need to coordinate the 6 wheels movement, use the servo loop to provide a constant time base.


Control loop needs to calculate the expected distance travelled for each wheel, compare to the actual distance traveled 
and use that to determine an error correction factor to apply to the PWM value.

Question: how can I implement this in a way that keeps the code well-structured?



MOVE:M1,D1234.5,V128,M2,D1234.5,V128,M3,D1234.5,V128,M4,D1234.5,V128,M5,D1234.5,V128,M6,D1234.5,V128;

Refactored code, cleaned it up quite a bit.
TODO:
Forget motion control right now, focus on getting all the wheels to move at the same speed
    - Calculate velocity in encoder ticks per second
    - Review the PID code that I found, make sure I understand it
    - Use the PID code to manage PWM
